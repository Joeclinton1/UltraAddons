# UltraAddons

This is a chrome extension to improve Durham's Ultra.

Currently the only thing it does it make it so you preview files instead of having to download them.

Please feel free to contribute to this project if you dislike some part of Ultra and want to improve it.

### Installation:
1. Download the extension by clicking on the green 'Code' button and then clicking on 'Download ZIP'.
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP folder.
3. Click on the Extensions icon in the Chrome toolbar and click on 'Manage Extensions'.
  (Alternatively, go to Chrome settings and click on Extensions there)
  
4. Enable 'Developer Mode' which is located at the top right.
5. Next, click on 'Load Unpacked'. This should open a window to select a folder.
6. Select the extracted folder. The extension should now be added.
